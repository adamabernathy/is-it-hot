# Is it hot yet?

Provides a simple and fun way to guess at what time of the day it will hit 100 degrees for the day.

Built using a very very very striped down version of [Google's Web Starter Kit](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/starter-kit/), with the addition of [gulp-gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-gh-pages) (`gulp deploy`) to deploy to GitHub Pages.

Licence MIT.  I wrote this in only a few hours for an office event and there is probably a few bugs in here :)

Made with :heart: in Salt Lake City.
